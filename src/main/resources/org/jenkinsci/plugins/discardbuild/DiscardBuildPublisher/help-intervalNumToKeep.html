<div>
    A specialized setting allowing a user to request that builds separated by a declared interval of
    build quantity are always kept. For e.g. setting quantity intervals to #15 would ensure builds #1, #16,
    #31, etc are kept. Please test this setting carefully to ensure the desired functionality is produced.
